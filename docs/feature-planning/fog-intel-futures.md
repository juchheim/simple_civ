## Future Feature Seeds: Fog, Intel, and Diplomacy Signals
- Last-seen strength cache: store enemy power when spotted; use for decisions until refreshed; decays over time to avoid stale intel.
- Power bands instead of exact numbers: expose coarse buckets (weak/comparable/strong or numeric ranges) to players and AI for shared expectations.
- Recon decay: reduce confidence or inflate assumed enemy power the longer since last sighting; encourages scouting.
- Contact-gated visibility: after first contact, always keep city count and last-known power band visible; no intel before contact.
- Intentional reveals: embassies/vision trades that temporarily expose exact power or map info, keeping scouting and diplomacy meaningful.
- Fog-aware risk buffer: when intel is partial, AIs assume a safety margin (e.g., +20% enemy strength) before declaring war.
