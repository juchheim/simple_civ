# AI Status

## Documented behavior
- Rulebook AI / Engine Hooks (docs/rules/simple-civ_v0.9_rulebook.md:944-973): city-site scoring = center yield + best 3 nearby tiles with +1 river bonus and +1 per nearby overlay; tile working priority depends on Progress vs Conquest vs behind-curve Food bias; war/peace heuristic (declare if enemy city within ~8 tiles and power ≥ defender, accept peace when losing or Progress risk); victory pursuit switches after Observatory or if enemy capital is in strike range with Armies.
- Dev-spec aiHeuristics (docs/dev-spec/v0.9/aiHeuristics.ts.md): `scoreCitySite` and `tileWorkingPriority` functions matching the rulebook weights/bonuses with explicit Balanced fallback.
- Dev-spec aiDecisions (docs/dev-spec/v0.9/aiDecisions.ts.md): `aiChooseTech` (Progress path to StarCharts, Conquest path to DrilledRanks/ArmyDoctrine, else cheapest useful), `aiWarPeaceDecision` (same war/peace heuristic as rulebook), and `aiVictoryBias` (Observatory => Progress, strike-range capital + Armies => Conquest, else Balanced).
- Dev-spec placeStarts (docs/dev-spec/v0.9/placeStarts.ts.md:6) expects start-site scoring to reuse the AI city-site scoring heuristic.
- Internal documentation (docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md, docs/doc_drift_report*.md) already flags AI heuristics/personality as missing and notes the doc-locked modules `aiHeuristics.ts.md` and `aiDecisions.ts.md` are absent.

## Implemented in code
- AI heuristics and decision helpers implemented per docs:
  - `scoreCitySite` / `tileWorkingPriority` live in `engine/src/game/ai-heuristics.ts` (the client now consumes them via the engine package) and match the rulebook weights/bonuses (center + best3 + river + overlay bonus, Progress vs Conquest tile priorities, food bias when behind curve).
  - Decision helpers (`aiVictoryBias`, `aiChooseTech`, `aiWarPeaceDecision`) live in `engine/src/game/ai-decisions.ts` and follow the doc heuristics for tech paths, war/peace triggers, and victory-goal switching.
- The AI turn loops now use those helpers (`engine/src/game/ai.ts`, called directly from the client via `@simple-civ/engine`):
  - Chooses tech based on the current victory bias (Progress path to StarCharts, Conquest path to DrilledRanks/ArmyDoctrine, else cheapest available).
  - Sets city builds with bias-aware priorities (science projects/buildings for Progress, military/form-army projects for Conquest, settlers + basics for Balanced).
  - **Expansion**: Builds Settlers even during war to prevent stagnation (added to war priority list).
  - **Victory**: Pursues Progress projects (`Observatory` chain) during war if military strength is sufficient (>= 3 units).
  - Assigns worked tiles using the doc tile-working priority per city, with a food catch-up bias when pop lags.
  - Settler automation: moves toward the best nearby city sites (using `scoreCitySite`) and founds cities; names are autogenerated.
  - Diplomacy automation: declares war when an enemy city is within 8 tiles and AI power ≥ defender; proposes/accepts peace if losing or Progress race risk is high.
  - Military micro: attacks nearby cities/units, then advances toward war targets; captures adjacent 0-HP cities (prioritizing them); war power now weights attack/defense heavier and gives armies extra weight.
  - **War Escalation**: Implemented turn-based aggression scaling. Late game (Turn 50+) AI becomes "Bloodthirsty" and refuses peace.
  - **Tactical Combat**:
    - **City Capture**: Uses "Clear the Way" logic to move blockers and "SwapUnits" to cycle attackers for maximum damage.
    - **War Prep**: Uses "Smart Buildup" to accumulate forces before declaring war (up to 10 turns prep).
  - **Diplomacy**:
    - **Domination Bypass**: Overwhelmingly strong AI (3x power) can bypass peace duration.
    - **No Peace**: Late game AI rejects peace to force a conclusion.
  - Stores the AI victory goal on the player (`aiGoal`) so bias is visible/persisted.
  - **Victory Logic (v0.99)**:
    - **Scholar Kingdoms**: Prioritizes Science buildings/projects to rush Tech victory.
    - **Starborne Seekers**: Prioritizes Spirit Observatory and Progress projects.
    - **River League**: Auto-assigner prioritizes river tiles (valued at +0.5 Prod) to maximize unique trait.
- Start placement now uses the documented city-site scoring heuristic instead of the prior ad-hoc formula; the client now consumes the shared engine generator (`engine/src/map/map-generator.ts`).
- AI turn autoskip loop remains in the client (`client/src/App.tsx:107-121`) and drives the new behavior for `isAI` players.
- Tests cover the AI heuristics/decisions/executor to lock doc rules (`engine/src/game/ai.test.ts`, `engine/src/game/ai.e2e.test.ts`), and the client simply imports the engine AI (no separate wrapper/tests remain).
- Fog is refreshed immediately after a unit moves via `refreshPlayerVision`, so revealed tiles show up as soon as movement finishes rather than waiting for end-of-turn.
- Civ-flavored AI personalities (data-only) added in `engine/src/game/ai/personality.ts`:
  - Aggression thresholds/distances, peace thresholds, settle/expansion biases, tech weights, project rush targets, and unit prefs per civ (ForgeClans hills/aggression, Scholar peace/science, River river/naval, Aetherian Titan spike, Starborne progress rush, Jade wide growth).
  - War/peace decisions, tech picks, city builds, and settler site scoring pull from the personality map; defaults remain neutral for new civs.

## Gaps vs docs
- Remaining approximations to tighten:
  - Progress-race risk uses opponent Progress milestones and active research toward StarCharts path; add more signals if desired.

## Steps to reach doc compliance
- All doc requirements under (1)-(4) are now implemented: shared heuristics/decisions, bias-aware engine executor, and targeted tests have been added.
