## Balance Assessment

### Improvements ✅

1. **AetherianVanguard now wins** - balance changes working
2. **StarborneSeekers significantly improved** - 30% win rate is healthy
3. **Fewer stalls** - 6% vs 12% previously
4. **Better victory rate** - 94% vs 88%

### Still Needs Work ⚠️

1. **JadeCovenant** - Still 0% win rate, needs more buffs
2. **ScholarKingdoms** - Still dominant at 52%, may need slight nerf
3. **ForgeClans** - Win rate dropped significantly (34% → 24%), may have been over-nerfed
4. **Settler death rate** - Still 92.5%, needs addressing
5. **Pop 10 gap on smaller maps** - Still 16-17 turns, may need map-size-specific tuning

### Recommendations

1. **JadeCovenant:** Needs significant buffs - consider stronger passive or wonder
2. **ScholarKingdoms:** Consider slight nerf to science bonus or tech costs
3. **ForgeClans:** May need slight buff if 24% win rate is too low
4. **Settler protection:** Still critical - increase HP or add defensive bonuses
5. **Map-size growth:** Consider slower growth on smaller maps to align pop 10 timing
