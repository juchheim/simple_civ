## How To Use This Report
- Use **Avg Net**, **Deficit Turns**, and **Austerity Turns** to determine if a civ's baseline economy is stable.
- Use **Avg Net (At War)**, **Supply Pressure**, and **Military Prod (per 100T)** to tune war upkeep pressure per civ.
- Use **Deficit Recoveries**, **Max Deficit Streak**, and **Military Under Stress** to verify AI adaptation during stalls.
- Use **Bank Uptime**, **Rush-Buys/Game**, **Saved Gold/Game**, and **Exchange Delay** to evaluate tactical gold payoff adoption.
- Use **Gold Building Adoption** + **Median First Completion Turn** to tune AI economy bias and building cost/tech timing.
- Use **Phase Net** and **Phase Austerity** to isolate whether issues are early snowball, midgame squeeze, or late-game collapse.
- Use **Map Size Sensitivity** to decide whether fixes should be global or map-size-specific.
